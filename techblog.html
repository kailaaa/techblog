<h2>you will lose your job to a robot</h2>
<h3>By Kaila Ayala</h3>

<p>This picture shows a robots telling a human that they are fired because these robots will soon take over our jobs.One study from Gartner Research states that while 1.8 million jobs will be lost by 2020, 2.3 million new ones will be created. the transition to a workless future is the biggest challenge by far, and it will have a major impact in society. We need to start finding a solution to this problem if we dont, we will have a jobless future.

I belive that in one or two decades, at least half of us will lose our job to robots. they can  take artistic jobs too. If youre a artist,Robots will paint and write and sculpt better than you. If you dig ditches, a robot will dig them better. If you’re a magazine writer, a robot will write your articles better. If you’re a doctor, robots can get test back to the patients afster than you can.

<h3>Will this become our future?</h3>
<h4>Brendan DePuy</h4>
<p>Good choice for an image.. You made a lot of valid points in your blog. I agree with when you said how there will be 2.3 million new jobs created to a workless future.  This will lead to people not having enough money to support their family.</p>

<p>If you believe humans will lose their jobs to robots then what do you think a good solution to fix this is? How can fix this? Can we fix this or is it bound to happen eventually?</p>
